STANK allows Unity developers to create smells, defined as Stanks in the package, and have their characters or NPCs be able to detect, track and react to those smells in a variety of ways. Whether you're making a game set in an idyllic flower meadow where your characters can stop to smell the roses or knee-deep in sewer stench, you can augment your game's immersion through using olfactory stimulus to drive response behaviors.

STANK provides basic functionality for playing particle systems, animations, and sound effects. Further functionality can be supported through the use of the custom event system driving STANK through STANKReactions. The STANKYLeg Animation layer supports Mecanim by default and builds a custom animation layer that will automatically trigger and play the AnimationClips you define without needing to modify your existing state machine.

STANK gives you the tools to add a new dimension of immersive gameplay mechanics for nearly any genre. The sense of smell is a core component of the human perception of the world. When you drive through your city and pass a restaurant, you can smell it and you get hungry. Drive by a sewer and your stomach may churn. You cry when you cut into an onion. STANK allows developers to add extra levels of depth and immersion to their games by utilizing the sense of smell.
